## 📖 Original Description
As a Marketing Ops user,
I want all Everlytic leads, including both intermediated and un‑intermediated leads, to be ingested into the IG pipeline,
so that all leads are visible, actionable, and not lost.


 Rule Sumary ( Ingestion- Unintermediated leads)


## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria (验收标准)
* * * * * * * If Everlytic does pass the PSI = Null value,  the lead must be ingested via API  into IG.
 Expectation:
Lead ingested
